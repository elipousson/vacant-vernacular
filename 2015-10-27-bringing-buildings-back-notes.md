## Notes from Bringing Buildings Back

## What is an abandoned property? (pp.1-3)

Abandoned property is **not** the same as a vacant property. A property vacant for a few days or weeks or awaiting planned rehabilitation may be vacant but not abandoned.

>An abandoned property is a property whose owner has stopped carrying out at least one of the significant responsibilities of property ownership, as a result of which the property is vacant or likely to become vacant in the immediate future.

Responsibilities of property ownership:

- Paying taxes and municipal charges
- Maintaining the property in conformity with relevant codes and ordinances
- Keeping property from becoming a nuisance to the community
  - Site of criminal or drug-related activity
  - Health hazard or (if unsecured) a safety risk to local children
  - Diminish property values or quality of life
  
Nuisance factors may be grounds for legal action against the owner; power of the government to "abate" a nuisance is a "basic principle of law in the United States." State laws define nuisances, only a few define abandoned properties.

Four common types of abandoned buildings:

- Multifamily rental properties
- Single-family homes
- Commercial or mixed-used properties
- Industrial properties

The property type most likely to be abandoned varies depending on the individual city or region (what is the real property stock? what economic factors affect the community?).

Vacant lots can also cause serious harm, e.g. illegal dumping or acculumation of debris creates health or safety hazards for the property's neighbors.

## How big is the abandoned property problem?(pp.3-4)

Comparisons from city to city or state to state are difficult. Measures for counting abandoned properties use different criteria:

- Buildings
- Dwelling units

## Why are properties abandoned? (pp.5-8)

Property abandonment "most often occurs when an owner concludes, rightly or wrongly, that the potential losses from continuing to occupy or maintain the property exceed the potential benefits." Economic reasons are the most important, often exacerbated by exploitative practices.

>Abandonment links location, physical obsolescence, and market obsolescenece, made worse by exploitation.

- Location: most important factor, if location is perceived as undesirable it can drive abandonment even without obsolesence {Note: I don't know why Mallach doesn't address location in more depth}
- Physical obsolesence: Physcial condition means a building cannot continue to be used productively without new investment that exceeds potential market value of the property.
- Market obsolesence: The size or layout of the building means that (with location and condition) it is no longer attractive to potential buyers/tenants.

>Location... dictates whether the owner can justify rehabilitating or replacing the property to overcome problems of physical or market obsolesence. A rational landlord will not invest money in a building unless she expects a return on that investment through either greater cash flow or future appreciation.

Decline in real estate demand leading to property abandonment often reflect the lack of local or regional economic growth.

>In Buffalo and Pittsburgh metropolitan areas, more people are leaving than arriving, and the supply of houses substantially exceeds the demand. Even where net regional growth is limited or nonexistent, newer and more affluent parts of the region may be growing, drawing population away from the region's inner core.

Different types of properties in the same location are affected by different market conditions. In a single area, owner-occupied properties may be abandoned but rental properties not.


_Table 1.1 (p.7) Abandoned Properties and Abandonment Triggers_: [transcribed into a tree diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/elipousson/ad787f9c9beb4cc48cd7)

Factors that "give rise to abandonment" can be described as "abandonment triggers." Abandonment trigger by type include:

- Rental property
  - Driven by negative cash flow
  - Some landlords attempt to improve cash flow by "milking" a property: cutting back on maitenance, stop paying property taxes for years before abandonment
- Single-family owner occupied properties
  - Often takes place after the death/relocation of owner
  - Associated with weak market (low resale prices, high length of time on market)
  - Exacerbated by fraud/predatory lending; practices can trap low-income families in substandard properties they can't afford to maintain, or trigger foreclosure after borrowers default on extortionate loan payments.
- Commercial or retail property
  - Shifts in consumer preferences and buying power
  - Small city downtowns, neighborhood shopping centers, older highway strips all hard hit by transition to malls, "big box" stores
- Industrial properties
  - Obsolesence of older industrial facilities, multistory buildings served by railroad/canal
  - Costs and uncertainties of real/perceived environmental contamination


## Why are abandoned properties a problem?

Effect on:

- Property Values
- Public Safety
- Public Health
- Fire Safety
- Taxpayers

>Of all of the factors blighting the lives of the people who live in troubled inner-city communities, abandoned properties may be the single most destructive, not least because they aggravate many of the other problems faced by such communities.
