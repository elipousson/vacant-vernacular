## Notes from Bringing Buildings Back

## What is an abandoned property?

Abandoned property is **not** the same as a vacant property. A property vacant for a few days or weeks or awaiting planned rehabilitation may be vacant but not abandoned.

>An abandoned property is a property whose owner has stopped carrying out at least one of the significant responsibilities of property ownership, as a result of which the property is vacant or likely to become vacant in the immediate future.

Responsibilities of property ownership

- Paying taxes and municipal charges
- Maintaining the property in conformity with relevant codes and ordinances
- Keeping property from becoming a nuisance to the community
