# Vacant Housing Background

Note: This document is a very rough early draft of a background statement and overview for the Vacant housing workshop and urban issues section of Local Preservation School. This materials will eventually be incorporated into lecture notes for [these workshop slides](http://slides.com/baltimoreheritage/vacant-house-workshop#/) or as a booklet designed to accompany the workshop for review by facilitators and/or participants.

## Introduction

Multiple building types:

- cornerstore commercial
- storefront commercial
- single-family detached
- rowhouse (attached)
- industrial
- religious
- school

This workshop will focus on housing but often overlaps with other categories of building types.

## Key Questions

- How many are houses and how many are something else?
- How many are row houses and how many are not?
- When are they built?

Of the vacant lots in Baltimore:
