# What is vacancy?
_Understanding abandoned houses in Baltimore_

This document is a script or outline intended to support the delivery of a facilitated workshop on understanding abandoned housing in Baltimore. This material was prepared by Eli Pousson for Baltimore Heritage to support a program at the Baltimore Museum of Art on November 21, 2015.

# Welcome

- What is vacancy? Why does it matter?
- Introduction to Baltimore Heritage
- Introduction to Open Hours at Baltimore Museum of Art
- What are we doing here today?
	- Learning about vacancy and vacant housing
	- Mix of lecture, discussion, activities
	- 90 minutes long
	- Teach people, bring people together, encourage participation and action around vacant housing
- Provide directions to restrooms, information about snacks
- Reminder to provide feedback at the end
- Goal to improve knowledge about the present and the past. Ideas about the past shape decision-making by individuals, organizations and policy-makers.

## Let’s get to know each other

_Note: The goal of this warm-up exercise is to encourage participants to learn about one another, recognize the diversity of experiences in the room and try to explore the personal dimensions of vacant housing. For each question, ask participants to raise their hands._

- Where do you live?
	- Baltimore City v. outside the city
- What kind of house do you live in?
	- attached v. detached
	- single v. multi-family housing
- Where were you born?
	- Native to Maryland v. outside the state
- How do you get to work?
	- Drive, walk, bike, or transit
- Have you ever taken any action in response to a vacant house?
	- Call 311, lot or block clean-up (shovel snow)
- How close do you live to a vacant house?
	- Vacant within 10 blocks, 5 blocks, your block, next door

## Let’s get to know Baltimore

_Note: This continues the same approach of the prior exercise detailed outline of the major topics and themes addressed by the workshop. These could be presented as a quiz.

Baltimore cannot be separated from the region.
Housing cannot be separated from employment and transportation.

Baltimore and the region:

- 23%  (622,793) of the metropolitan area (2,710,489 people)

Key facts about employment:

- 2/3 of jobs in Baltimore are held by people who live outside the city.

Key facts about transportation:

- 2013 Census Data: solo drivers in the Baltimore region get where they're going the fastest, in 29 minutes on average — though that still is the fourth-slowest in the country. Carpoolers face an average 31-minute commute, while public transit riders clock in at about 55 minutes. [Source](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-commuter-woes-20150628-story.html)

# What is vacant housing? Why does it matter?**

Abandoned property is **not** the same as a vacant property. A property vacant for a few days or weeks or awaiting planned rehabilitation may be vacant but not abandoned.

> An abandoned property is a property whose owner has stopped carrying out at least one of the significant responsibilities of property ownership, as a result of which the property is vacant or likely to become vacant in the immediate future.

**Responsibilities** of property ownership:

- Paying taxes and municipal charges
- Maintaining the property in conformity with relevant codes and ordinances
- Keeping property from becoming a nuisance to the community
  - Site of criminal or drug-related activity
  - Health hazard or (if unsecured) a safety risk to local children
  - Diminish property values or quality of life
	  
Nuisance factors may be grounds for legal action against the owner; power of the government to "abate" a nuisance is a "basic principle of law in the United States." State laws define nuisances, only a few define abandoned properties.[^1]

“According to Baltimore Housing, the city’s metric is defined by the number of vacant building notices issued by the city’s Housing Code Enforcement division. “Prior to the issuance of a notice, each building is inspected, photographed, and documented, and a determination is made that the building is in violation of Section 116 of the city’s Building, Fire, and Related Codes.” These violations can include damage such as broken windows, open doors, or holes in the roof. Notably, the city does not count other unoccupied houses that may have been missed by inspectors or that are unoccupied but do not have obvious indications of decay.”[^2]

_How many vacant houses does Baltimore have?_

- **Baltimore Housing**: 16,636 properties with VBNs (2014)
- **U.S. Census**: 46,782 vacant dwelling units (2010)
- **Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance**: 31,370 vacant properties (2015)

“Some advocates are concerned that Baltimore Housing’s metric undercounts the number of vacant properties and thus understates the city’s vacancy problem. To demonstrate this challenge, a group promoting affordable housing, called Housing Our Neighbors (HON), conducted a survey in 2014 of unoccupied houses in several East Baltimore communities including McElderry Park and Middle East. Volunteers visited each block, talked with neighbors, and used a checklist to determine if a house was vacant. Out of 381 vacant buildings surveyed, the group found that 159 did not have city-issued Vacant Building Notices.”[^3]

# How did we get here?

_Everybody_ knows how we got here:

> Too many houses. Too few people.

So when did Baltimore’s problem with vacant houses begin?

- Where did the houses come from?
- Where did the people go?

How should we understand the cultural history of vacancy?

## Timeline

Even when people in Baltimore try to explain our “vacant house problem,” often our answers are incomplete at best and misleading at worst. 

- A professor at Johns Hopkins University might bring up the $1.5 billion loss for Bethlehem Steel in 1982 -- a watershed moment in a decade that lost thousands of “good jobs” to neoliberalism and globalization. 
- A neighborhood activist in Druid Heights might point back to the unrest that rocked the city after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King — leaving a legacy of vacant lots and vacant buildings. 
- A retiree living in Columbia who grew up shopping at downtown department stories may sadly recall when O'Neil's closed the day after Christmas in 1955. 
- An amateur urban planner on Facebook might talk about how the city’s population peaked around 1 million in 1950 before falling more than a third to 620,961 people in 2010. 

Limited as they are, each of these stories has power to shape public policy around vacant housing. Do we invest in tearing houses down or fixing them up?

Concerns over population loss and vacant housing in Baltimore date back nearly two centuries. Writing in **1831**, publisher Hezekiah Niles reflected on the city’s population loss during the economic crisis of the **early 1820s**, recalling how “because of the want of employment in those years, [there was a](#) consequent removal of the people, to the north, south, east and west.” The city had recovered from the severe depression and Niles could then boast that, “There is hardly a house unoccupied, though a very large number was built the last season.”

With capital from men like Hezekiah Niles, as well as the labor from thousands of recent immigrants, enslaved and free blacks, Baltimore grew quickly. The city more than doubled in population between **1830 and 1850**. Growth came with new patterns of land use around Baltimore’s downtown. Property-owners tore down hundreds of old homes to make way for new warehouses and commercial buildings.

In May **1847**, the National Intelligencer on a rare demolition “deemed worthy of notice,” wrote:

> “workmen are now engaged tearing down the very oldest house in Baltimore; to erect in its stead an elegant new warehouse. […](#) Daguerreotype sketches and other drawings were taken of it, to preserve as relics, prior to its demolition.”

In a later example, from **January 1891**, locals gathered at the scene of the demolition of a former suburban mansion overwhelmed by the city built up around it with a plan to take more than drawings. As the crowd watched the “quaint but pretentious little building of classic architecture” disappear “before the march of modern improvement” they “eagerly gathered “pieces of its mantel-pieces and bits of its woodwork […](#) for souvenirs.” The home, known as Tusculum, was fondly remembered as the host of a vibrant arts and poetry society in the early 1800s. Despite the building’s neglect, it was still occupied by a “family of colored people” who “made the noted Tusculum their home” but likely had little power to protest their eviction.

Between **1850 and 1880**, the city’s population doubled again and new buildings had sprawled over the city limits and into “the Belt” – an area built up with factories and clusters of suburban cottages that surrounded the city to the east, west and north. Throughout this period, inadequate sewers and frequent outbreaks of disease encouraged many well-off residents to leave their homes every summer.

The **1888 annexation** of Baltimore County pushed the city line west past the Gwynns Falls and added 36,000 people to the city's population. Immigration contributed even more significantly to the city's growth and between 1880 and 1900 the population had increased by 53%. To house this new influx, the number of dwellings increased by 76% with the quick construction of block upon block of row houses. The city's rapid residential development led _The Baltimore Sun_ in November **1908** to label the city "The City of Homes," writing:

> “That Baltimore in her rapid growth is not only the queen city of the South, but is outstripping by far other large cities in its claim to the title of "The City of Homes," is attested by the almost unprecedented demand for modern dwellings and the quickness of builders to realize this demand."

By **1910**, some observers clearly saw how suburban growth at the periphery and disinvestment from the core drove Baltimore’s emerging vacant house problem. However, then and perhaps now, anxiety over high property taxes, worries over diminished property values and white supremacy largely defined the terms of the debate. Rather than challenge the enormous public subsidies for suburban growth or encourage more substantial investment in the maintenance of older city neighborhoods (by then occupied largely by recent immigrants and African Americans), the city instead fought vacancy by writing racism into local housing laws.

In August 1910, the Baltimore Police board released a “complete census of the number of houses, both vacant and occupied in the city,” undertaken at the request of real estate firm of William Martien & Company. At the time, real estate agent James Cary Martien argued: 

> “The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore.” 

Martien’s focus on supply and demand neglected to engage for the importance role of racial segregation. In the weeks that followed this publication, a series of letters to the Sun responded to the news and attempted to closely link vacant homes to the perceived threat of “negro invasion.”

When some residents argued that high property taxes contributed to owners abandoning their homes, a letter from a northwest Baltimore resident (published on August 27 under the name “Pure White”) wrote: 

> “When a man works and saves and buys a home thinking it will be his shelter in his old age, and wakes up some morning to find he has a negro neighbor, he feels hurt and aggrieved that he has to give up his home, but he moves. [...](#) The real estate men—a few of them, not all—are to blame for the vacant houses and with them, lies the remedy.” 

A letter signed by “Justice” appeared on September 2 echoed this sentiment and demanded elected officials protect his neighborhood from “invasion” (and vacant houses) writing: 

> “There are several vacant houses in the block, and this fear may be the potent cause of non-rental or sale. Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest.” 

Another letter, appearing on September 15, distinguished the “temporary” vacancy of the past with the “growing” issue that faced the city: 

> “The vacant house problem in the city should be one of grave concern at this time to our municipal administrators, to our real estate agents and to those having the welfare of the city at heart. It is not a temporary but a growing evil t hat is confronting and threatening every owner of property. The number of vacant houses has grown and grown until at last there is common alarm in the matter, and justly so...” 

Residents like “Pure White” and “Justice” won a victory of sorts on December 20, 1910, when Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for the bill’s sponsor, Council Samuel L. West. West represented the northwestern neighborhoods, noted in that year’s police report as having the city’s highest concentration of vacant houses. 

The new law was the first city ordinance in the nation to require racially segregated housing. It forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” Maryland courts soon overturned the law as unconstitutional but the legacy of segregated housing endures. 

Vacant housing is typically overlooked in Baltimore’s history of segregation but resident accounts demonstrate how it played a critical role in stoking white fears and reinforcing a racialized perception of “blight” in the decades that followed. 

In **1914**, with the start of World War II, debates over vacant housing retreated as the home building industry ground to near complete halt. Construction permits for new dwellings in Baltimore dwindled from 2,484 in 1916, to 885 in 1917, and just 378 in 1918. Housing growth surged back in the 1920s but in the 1930s and 1940s concerns over “blight” and abandonment moved in new directions with more ambitious goals of transforming the city. 

In **1932**, Charles Dana Loomis, a Harvard educated architect, commented on the issue in a long feature article for the Baltimore Sun under the headline “Putting Abandoned City Areas Back into Use.” Loomis sat on the AIA Baltimore Executive Committee between 1929 and 1941. His piece for the Sun gives a preview of the vision for housing and the city that he brought to his later work as Technical Director of Public Housing Projects for Housing Authority of Baltimore City between 1938 and 1946:

> “What modern and reasonably attractive use can be made of a piece of land eighteen feet wide and over a hundred feet deep? The ingenuity of man has found no answer to this, and this piece of land is what the average deed describes in Baltimore's dying areas. What is more, this kind of property is in hopeless future competition with countless undeveloped acres right over the city's borders. There is too much good land close to the city...
> In Baltimore we have today large areas, which are used so badly that the buildings on the land are little better than wrecks. Many are vacant, boarded up, and even sometimes in actual danger of collapse. Anyone who does not believe that this dilapidation exists should walk through the alleys. Owners who still keep up a brave front are showing their destitution on their rear exposures. The seat is often out of our pants even though the coat front is well brushed.”

November 1935 titled “SAYS BALTIMORE CEASES TO GROW: Dr. McDouglc, Goucher Professor, Warns City May Become "Rotten Borough" URGES REHOUSING PLAN Criticizes Course Of Real Estate Operators -- Addresses Engineers Club”

> Baltimore's growing days are [over] and the city will become just a borough" if building activities continue to push outward, Dr. Ivan McDouglc, professor of economics sociology at Goucher College, yesterday in an address before Engineers' Club.

Description from 1937 HOLC Map:

> The Third grade or C areas are characterized by age, obsolescence, and change of style; expiring restrictions or lack of them; infiltration of a lower grade population; the presence of influences with increase sales resistance such as inadequate transportation, insufficient utilities, perhaps heavy tax burdens, poor maintenance of homes etc. “Jerry” built area are included, as well as neighborhoods lacking homogeneity. Generally, these have reached the transition period. Good mortgage lenders are more conservative in the Third grade or C areas and hold loan commitments under the lending ration for the A and B areas. The fourth grade or D area represent those neighborhoods in which the things that are now taking place in the C neighborhoods, have already happened. They are characterized by detrimental influences in a pronounced degree, undesirable population of an infiltration of it. Low percentage of home ownership, very poor maintenance and often vandalism prevail. Unstable incomes of the people and difficult collections are usually prevalent. The areas are broader than the co-called slum districts. Some mortgage lenders may refuse to make loans in these neighborhoods and others will lend only on a conservative basis. These maps and description have been carefully checked with competent local real estate brokers and mortgage lenders, and we believe they represent a fair and composite opinion of the best qualified local people. In using them we do not mean to imply that good mortgages do not exist or cannot be made in the Third and Fourth grade areas, but we do think they should be made as serviced on a different basis than in the First and Second grade areas.  

During World War II, concern over blight focused on housing “congestion” rather than vacancy but there is evidence of a growing number of uninhabitable buildings. Indeed, the location of uninhabitable buildings in segregated African American neighborhoods exacerbated an affordable housing crisis for black Baltimoreans. From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued "growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied." The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed "the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type."

An October 1948 editorial in the Baltimore Sun described the “colored section of most cities” as “already dangerously overcrowded” and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.

Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black resident of Greater Rosemont recalling the history of white flight in the late 1940s:

> “Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets... But it wasn’t integration... it was an evacuation.”

Ruins In Baltimore Are Progress Signs, Baltimore Sun, November 25, 1951:

> ”Building wreckers have cleared the way in Baltimore for a new and better city for nearly 50 years. In an average year they tear down between 400 and 500 houses. Buildings that would cover eight to ten city blocks are destroyed annually--those that come down would house nearly 2,000 people. But the record shows that the path of ruin has always been one of progress."

Additional public support for growth:

- GI Bill of 1944: provided tuition assistance and mortgage subsidies to returning serviceman after World War II, enabling many American families to buy new homes.
- Federal Highway Transportation Act of 1956: created the interstate highway system.

Mayor Theodore P. McKeldin made his perspective on vacant housing clear echoing the importance of protecting children from the threat of harm in abandoned houses In 1964, the Sun quoted McKeldin:

> ”Vacant houses not only have a blighting effect on the areas around them but they are also an open invitation to vandals and a potential hazard for children who attempt to play within such buildings.”

1974: Robert C. Embry remarked, "There is nothing like a boarded-up house to pull down a whole block," the Sun called it a “truism echoed by landlords and residents.”


1987: 

> Over the last twenty-five years, Bdtimore has lost a fifth of its population,more than half of its white population, and a hard to enumerate but very largeproportion of its middle clasq white and black. It has lost more than ten p€r centof its iobs since 1970, and those that remain are increasingly held by cornmuters.By 1985, the city's median household income was iust over half that of sur-rounding counties and the needs of its poor for services were far more than thecity's eroded tax base could support.

Note the glaring absence from Abell Foundation report—no mention of race, racism, or segregation.

- Too many houses in the suburbs
- Demand is shaped by culture and economy
- Market is shaped by racism

Explanations of what the urban crisis:

- behavior and values of the poor, and the role of federal social programs in fostering a culture of joblessness and dependency in inner cities.
- structural explanations for inequality and urban poverty:
	- effects of economic restructuring (following William Julius Wilson)
	- continuing significance of racial discrimination (following Gary Orfield and Douglas Massey).
- politics, emphasizing the marginalization of cities in American social policy, particularly in the aftermath of the urban unrest and racial conflict of the 1960s.

Thomas Sugrue, The Origins of the Urban Crisis:

> “…that the origins of the urban crisis are much earlier than social scientists have recognized, its roots deeper, more tangled, and perhaps more intractable. No one social program or policy, no single force, whether housing segregation, social welfare programs, or deindustrialization, could have driven Detroit and other cities like it from their positions of economic and political dominance; there is no simple explanation for the inequality and marginality that beset the urban poor. It is only through the complex and interwoven histories of race, residence, and work in the postwar era that the state of today’s cities and their impoverished residents can be fully understood and confronted. “


# How do vacant houses happen?

Property abandonment "most often occurs when an owner concludes, rightly or wrongly, that the potential losses from continuing to occupy or maintain the property exceed the potential benefits." Economic reasons are the most important, often exacerbated by exploitative practices.

> Abandonment links location, physical obsolescence, and market obsolescence, made worse by exploitation.

- **Location**: most important factor, if location is perceived as undesirable it can drive abandonment even without obsolescence
- **Physical obsolescence**: Physical condition means a building cannot continue to be used productively without new investment that exceeds potential market value of the property.
- **Market obsolescence**: The size or layout of the building means that (with location and condition) it is no longer attractive to potential buyers/tenants.

> Location... dictates whether the owner can justify rehabilitating or replacing the property to overcome problems of physical or market obsolescence. A rational landlord will not invest money in a building unless she expects a return on that investment through either greater cash flow or future appreciation.

Decline in real estate demand leading to property abandonment often reflect the lack of local or regional economic growth.

> In Buffalo and Pittsburgh metropolitan areas, more people are leaving than arriving, and the supply of houses substantially exceeds the demand. Even where net regional growth is limited or nonexistent, newer and more affluent parts of the region may be growing, drawing population away from the region's inner core.

Different types of properties in the same location are affected by different market conditions. In a single area, owner-occupied properties may be abandoned but rental properties not.

## Abandonment Trigger Bingo

_Background for workshop leader:_

- 90 bingo cards divided into 2 groups (neighborhoods) of 45 cards each:
	- Group 1: using only numbers 1-25 (only bad)
	- Group 2: using numbers 1-50 (mix of bad and good)
- Cards are grids of 8 numbers with one free square
- Assign multiple numbers to each event
- 200 counters cut from red paper
- Add all the balls (1-25) to the bingo machine ahead of time
- Ask for a volunteer to help operate the bingo machine
- Turn the crank until a ball fall out
- Read the number out loud - then read the descriptions of a corresponding event

_Script:_

A lot of different things can happen to a house. Sometimes good things happen – the school nearby wins an award for excellence or a great restaurant opens a few blocks away. Sometimes bad things happen – an owner gets a high-interest loan they can never pay off or a small roof leak turns into a flood.

Abandonment usually is not the result of a single event or “trigger.” More often, vacant houses are the result of a combination of different factors. Are those factors random – vacant houses are just unlucky? Or are there patterns? We’re playing a game of vacant house bingo to find out.

Each player gets one card. Your bingo card represents a single house here in Baltimore. We start our story in 1950 and work our way up to the present pulling 15 numbers over 65 years. Each time I pull a number, we’ll announce a new event. If you have that number on your card, take a token to cover the square.

When you fill your card, shout “vacant!” You win. Baltimore loses.  Unfortunately, we won’t have just one winner – after all, Baltimore has over 16,000 unlucky vacant houses. When we reach the present, we’ll stop and try to figure out the neighborhood vacancy rate. I’ll warn you in advance —this will be a bit depressing.

Abandonment triggers


**What do we learn from this?**

As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote last year in The Atlantic, this policy meant that the federal government had endorsed a system of financial apartheid under which:

> “whites looking to achieve the American dream could rely on a legitimate credit system backed by the government. Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport.”

2013: for instance, blacks were denied on 25.5 percent of their applications for mortgages to purchase a home, compared with 12.2 percent for whites, according to an analysis of the government mortgage data by the Federal Reserve. The higher denial rate for blacks might, for instance, be explained by differences in credit history and the amount of money that borrowers can put down as a deposit.

2013: 797 loans were made to blacks in the city, a seemingly tiny number considering that Baltimore’s black population totals almost 400,000. Some 2,000 loans were made to the city’s 175,000 whites.

> One of the chief concerns among consumer advocates is that banks have effectively written off certain neighborhoods. Lenders, for instance, may shun creditworthy borrowers in neighborhoods where blacks are the majority because they may not believe that house prices will rise by much in such areas. But if banks avoid economically challenged areas for that reason, it could make it more unlikely that house prices will rise. (NYT)

# What can be done about vacant housing?

In campaigning to convince Philadelphians of the necessity of establishing the city’s first fire department, Benjamin Franklin “argued that prevention of a catastrophic city-wide fire was preferable to rebuilding a burned city from scratch,” noting that **“an Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure.”** By the close of 1736, Philadelphia had its first volunteer fire department, the Union Fire Company.

There are a wide variety of tools available for prevention:

- Property information and early warning systems
- Improving economic viability of at-risk, absentee-owned properties
	  - Loan programs
	  - Tax relief
	  - Insurance
	  - Training and technical assistance for landlords
- Preventing abandonment of owner-occupied housing
	  - Loss of property through inability to pay
		- Foreclosure prevention
		- Predatory lending
	  - Loss of property through market failure
		- Community brokerage
		- Presale improvement programs
		- Senior citizen outreach
- Enforcement and intervention
	  - Code enforcement

## How does Baltimore make decisions about what to do with vacant houses?


Questions to guide the decision around whether to demolish or preserve any given property: 

- What is the quality of the building, and does it have particular architectural or historical value worth preserving?
- What is the existing fabric of the neighborhood in which it is located, and does the building's presence contribute to that fabric?
- What potential development or revitalization opportunities, if any, will the demolition of the building create?
- How severe is the nuisance impact or other harm from the building in its present condition, and does that impact outweigh the loss of the reuse potential of the building?

**Rehabilitation and the market gap**

_Example_: Development of 1125, 1127 & 1129 Hollins Street by Jubilee Baltimore

- Development Cost: $858,000;
- Assessed Value: $330,000;
- Community Legacy: $180,000;
- Market Gap: 62%

## Let’s discuss what you think should be done about vacant housing

1. Here is what we know about the cost of different options:

2. Here is what we know about the neighborhood:
	- No. of houses
	- No. of vacant houses
	- No. of houses in poor condition
	- Median sale price
	- Vacancy rate
3. Discuss how you want to divide your resources:
	- Demolition
	- Salvage
	- Stabilization
	- Rehabilitation Incentive (Market Gap Subsidy)
4. Try on different roles during the discussion
	- Neighborhood leader
	- Neighborhood resident
	- Housing official
5. Report back to the group

What is this exercise trying to teach?

**You never have enough money!** Additional subsidy is always required for rehabilitation projects:

- Historic Tax Credit
- Low Income Housing Tax Credit
- Homeownership Incentives
- Social Enterprise Financing

**Vacancy is a larger problem than we can solve in the short-term.**
- City funding is insufficient to address through demolition alone

# Taking action

- Call 311 to report code violations
- Connect neighbors with resources before problems begin
- Join and support your community association
- Survey vacant properties in your neighborhood
- Utilize self-help nuisance abatement
- Work with Baltimore Housing & City Agencies

Conclusions from the Abell Foundation Report:

- “A large percentage of Baltimore’s low- and middle-income tenants and homeowners continue to pay a high portion of their income for housing costs, yet Vacants to Value does not address the city’s affordable housing crisis.”
