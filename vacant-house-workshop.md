# Vacant House Workshop

I am developing an interactive workshop to teach Baltimore City residents about vacant housing. I'd like participants to walk away with a better understanding of what are the causes for vacant housing in the past, how vacant houses are shaped by public policy today, and what strategies community leaders and city officials are using to address vacant housing as an issue. My model for this workshop is the ["What is Affordable Housing?" workshop kit](http://welcometocup.org/Projects/EnvisioningDevelopment/WhatIsAffordableHousing) created by the Center for Urban Pedagogy. The project is an extension of [a research paper](https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-one-of-a-draft-paper-for-the-vaf-conference-in-chicago/) I wrote for the Vernacular Architecture Forum meeting in Chicago in June 2015. 

## Announcement

What do you know about vacant houses? Baltimore City has over 16,000 vacant homes that contribute to a wide. Are they "eyesores" that all need to be torn down? Or historic buildings with potential for reuse? Bring your questions and ideas to a free workshop on vacant housing in Baltimore dedicated to exploring this important issue facing Baltimore's historic neighborhoods.

Don't expect a lecture! Through interactive activities we will break down the issues (population, economic and social) that drive Baltimore's vacant house problems past and present. We will also discuss the strategies Baltimore is using to address vacant houses from reuse to demolition and where citizens and community groups fit in.

## Worskshop Ideas

- Ask people to share their own stories and experiences with vacant housing. Add those stories to a share conceptual map that illustrates the variety of "problems" created by vacant housing.
- Interactive exercises to illustrate the changing location of Baltimore's population. Ask people to move around the room to illustrate regional growth and the movement of residents to the suburbs following World War II.
- Create hexagonal tiles labeled with the "causes" of vacant housing and specific examples of vacant buildings. These tiles can be used by participants to create conceptual maps that illustrate the way in which each vacant house is different but is often affected by the same set of broader issues.
- Create an activity with fake "Monopoly" money that invites participants to try to step into the shoes of a vacant house flipper, a city housing official or a home-owner on a fixed income. This activity is intended to encourage empathy and promote an understanding that different points of view shape how this issue is percieved and what solutions are promoted.
