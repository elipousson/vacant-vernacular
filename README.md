# Vacant Vernacular

This repository is a collection of materials related to an ongoing research project into the preservation issues surrounding vacancy and vacant houses in Baltimore, Maryland.

## What is this project?

This project is a lot of little things that I am still in the process of gathering into a more coherent whole. All of this materials is presented as-is and may or may not be useful at this point.

## What is the history of this project?

I started this project in July 2014 as a presentation for the National Alliance of Preservation Comissions (NAPC) Forum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania along with several colleagues from the Preservation Rightsizing Network. I presented a paper based on this same research at the Vernacular Archiecture Forum in Chicago, Illinois together with Michael Allen from St. Louis, Missouri.

I am currently developing an [interactive](https://github.com/elipousson/vacant-vernacular/blob/master/vacant-house-workshop.md)
 on the topic of vacant housing for presentation at the Baltimore Musuem of Art in November 2015. I'm hoping to develop this into a larger toolkit or resource guide for dealing with vacancy issues in Baltimore and/or other legacy cities.
