# Preservation and the Future of Baltimore’s Vacants (Abstract)

In Baltimore, Maryland; Saint Louis, Missouri; Detroit, Michigan and scores of other American legacy cities, vacant and abandoned buildings are a major issue with no clear solution. Vacant houses are at the forefront of debates around “shrinking cities” and “rightsizing”—debates that rarely mentions the architects or builders who designed collapsing rowhouses or the “historic integrity” of blighted bungalows. For most urban planners and housing activists, each vacant building is reduced into a single point of data, little more than an abstraction. In Baltimore, the city holds an estimated 16,000 vacant properties—mostly attached rowhouses built before WWII—including many contributing resources within designated historic districts. This is a preservation issue that is about more than just architecture. It is intertwined with urgent issues around racial segregation, policing, and the economics of regional growth and development. What does the future hold for the preservation of vacant buildings and how can Baltimore preservation respond proactively to emerging trends?

Historic preservation advocates have started working to address vacant buildings through the publication of _[Historic Preservation and Rightsizing: Current Practices and Resources Survey](http://www.achp.gov/achp-rightsizing-report.pdf)_ for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in 2012, the [Preservation in Legacy Cities conference](http://cua6.urban.csuohio.edu/conference/LegacyCityPreservation/) in Cleveland, Ohio in June 2014, and the start of the [Preservation Rightsizing Network](rightsizeplace.org) in 2015. Such efforts recognize that new trends in **population**, **economy**, and **everyday technology** pose significant challenges for the preservation of vacant and abandoned vernacular buildings around the country:

- The cost of city administration is increasing faster than population growth, (driven by rising infrastructure and pension costs) placing new limits on funding for both demolition and development.
- Housing officials and elected officials are focusing on strategic demolition (the demolition of larger clusters of vacant properties also known as blight elimination) as the preferred strategy for addressing vacant housing.
- Urban planners are increasingly adopting GIS-based analysis and data-driven planning tools—methods that are unfamiliar for many preservationists.

Responding to Baltimore’s ongoing effort to expand the demolition of vacant properties, Eli Pousson’s paper briefly describes the city’s long history of vacant housing from the mid 19th to the 21st century. It continues to analyze the preservation issues and context surrounding vacant housing today and, based on the projected future of vacant housing in Baltimore, attempts to define what preservation outcomes are possible for vacant hosing and how they may be achieved.

_This proposal was submitted for consideration for the [7th National Forum on Historic Preservation Practice](http://meyerhoff.goucher.edu/eblasts/welch/HistoricPreservation_50Years.html) (March 2016) in October 2015. This proposal is based on an proposal by Eli Pousson and Michael Allen accepted for presentation at the Vernacular Architecture Forum meeting in Chicago, Illinois in June 2015._
